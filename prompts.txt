Hey Claude, I’d like your help reviewing and improving a small open-source rescue project I’m working on with a volunteer named Alaska in Koh Phangan (Thailand).

The goal is to create a basic visual map + list of all dogs on the island that need to be neutered or spayed only. It’s meant to be used internally by rescue organizations like PACS, not the public.

🔍 Core Requirements (from Alaska):
	•	The tool must be very simple, no mobile app needed.
	•	It should collect key info via WhatsApp (or a form): age, sex, temperament, location (Google Maps link), contact, optional photo.
	•	It should display a map (e.g. Folium or Leaflet) of these animals by location, with filtering by category if possible (e.g. “neutering”, “medical”, “chained”, “rehoming”).
	•	It must be accessible via link (e.g. hosted on GitHub Pages).
	•	If successful, the project should be open-source friendly and easily extended by others.

🔗 Source of truth is this Google Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i9tfIcqu16OVwPAT_Ae7O3fy2fAzL4FZ5QTqzwJeKRk/edit?usp=sharing

✅ I’ve already:
	•	Created a Python script (generate_map.py) that reads a CSV version of that sheet and generates an index.html interactive map.
	•	Hosted the result via GitHub Pages.

I’d like your help with suggestions on how to:
	•	Make the data collection flow easier or automated (e.g. WhatsApp integration, Google Form + Zapier, n8n)
	•	Improve the UX or filtering options for the map
	•	Keep it lightweight and human-friendly, while still open for contribution
	•	Possibly sync the Google Sheet directly into the map with no need for manual CSV updates

Here’s a sample row from the data:
